# Go Parser Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to write a parser. Each directory builds on top of the previous one.

The final directory shows a nearly complete JSON parser. However, it's not necessarily the most efficient implementation.
The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the best ways to write a parser using goyacc.
